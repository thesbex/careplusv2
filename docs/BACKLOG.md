# Post-MVP backlog

Anything explicitly out of the 7-day MVP goes here. Append-only list of ideas/features/gaps, grouped by theme. Decide priority at MVP exit.

## Clinical

- Consultation amendment (v2, v3… chain) with full audit trace
- Out-of-range vitals alerts (configurable thresholds per cabinet)
- Graphs of vitals over time (weight, blood pressure, glycemia)
- Stupéfiants / psychotropes: enforced ordonnance sécurisée legal format (Moroccan requirements)
- Ordonnance renewal in 1 click for chronic patients
- Chronic condition follow-up module (diabetes HbA1c trend, HTA, asthma peak-flow)
- Vaccination schedule + reminders
- Lab results inbound: mark analysis as "result received", attach PDF, flag doctor
- ICD-10 diagnosis coding (optional autocomplete)
- Templates per consultation type (first visit, follow-up, certificate, vaccination)
- Clinical exam templates by appareil (cardio, pulm, abdo, neuro, ORL)
- Generated courrier de liaison to specialist

## Scheduling & presence

- **Email reminder batch** : cron J-1 (et J-7 pour les contrôles) qui envoie un email au patient pour lui rappeler son rendez-vous (nouvelle consultation ou visite de contrôle planifiée). Provider email abstrait (SMTP cabinet ou SaaS comme Brevo/Mailjet). Template bilingue FR/AR. Opt-out patient gérable depuis le dossier. Lié à `AppointmentType` (CONSULTATION | CONTROLE | URGENCE) — le type `CONTROLE` est créé lors de la planification du contrôle en fin de consultation (voir WORKFLOWS.md WF4).
- SMS reminder cron J-1 with opt-in patient response parsing
- Waiting-list with auto-notify on cancellation
- Recurring appointments (chronic patient every 3 months)
- Holiday calendar auto-imported yearly from Moroccan official list
- SSE real-time queue (replace polling)
- Waiting-room display screen (tablet view with "next patient")
- No-show counter per patient, flag after 3 consecutive
- **Mobile congé screen** : port `/parametres` leave management to mobile (CongesPage.mobile.tsx). Low-priority since secretaries manage this on desktop.
- **Congé overlap warning** : when creating a new leave that overlaps an existing confirmed appointment, show a warning listing the affected appointments (don't auto-cancel, just inform). Requires a query joining `scheduling_appointment` with the new leave date range.

## Multi-practitioner cabinet

- **Practitioner selector in PriseRDVDialog** : when a cabinet has more than one doctor, the secretary needs to pick which doctor the RDV is for. Currently `practitionerId` is always the logged-in user. Add a `<Select>` in step 2 of the dialog populated from `GET /api/practitioners` (new endpoint listing active identity_user with MEDECIN role).
- **Multi-practitioner agenda view** : allow switching between practitioners in the agenda toolbar (or a side-by-side day view). A secretary should be able to see all doctors' agendas at once.
- **Practitioner management screen** : ADMIN screen to create/deactivate practitioners, set working hours per practitioner (currently working hours are cabinet-global), and assign roles.
- **Per-practitioner revenue split** : moved here from Billing — relevant only once multi-practitioner is wired.

## Billing

- Feuille de soins AMO (CNSS, CNOPS, private mutuelles) PDF generation
- Cash register daily close (rapport Z) with per-mode totals
- Insurance claim tracking (generated, submitted, reimbursed, rejected)
- Devis (quote for non-reimbursed acts)
- Relance impayés workflow
- VAT paramétrable per act
- Per-practitioner revenue split (when cabinet → clinic with multiple doctors)

## Pregnancy vertical

- Full pregnancy module (declaration, plan, visits, biometrics, alerts, closure)
- Ultrasound result capture
- Bio panel tracking per trimester
- Auto-create child record on delivery

## Documents & files

- **Ancien dossier patient** : lors de la création d'un patient, permettre de joindre des documents existants (anciennes prescriptions, comptes-rendus radio, bilans biologiques). Nécessite : table `patient_document` (id, patient_id, category enum PRESCRIPTION/RADIO/BIOLOGIE/AUTRE, filename, content_type, stored_path, uploaded_at, uploaded_by), endpoint `POST /patients/{id}/documents` (multipart), `GET /patients/{id}/documents`, stockage local configurable (répertoire `data/documents/` sur l'on-prem, path relatif stocké en base). Côté frontend : section "Documents apportés" dans le panneau Nouveau patient (upload via `<input type=file multiple>`, preview liste nom+type), plus tab "Documents" dans le dossier patient.
- Patient document uploads (scans, photos, PDFs)
- Drag-drop from device camera (mobile PWA)
- WYSIWYG template editor with variable picker
- Multiple templates per document type + selection at print time
- Watermark "copie" on reprinted invoices

## Notifications

- Email + SMS integration (provider abstraction, Moroccan SMS provider)
- In-app notifications center per user
- WhatsApp share link for PDFs (deep link with pre-filled message)

## Admin & ops

- Audit log UI with filters (user, action, entity, date range)
- Backup cloud: daily dump, encryption, upload, rotation, alerts
- Restore from cloud button in admin UI
- Auto-update mechanism (check → download → backup → migrate → restart)
- License module (activation key, feature flags, expiration)
- Multi-language UI (Arabic RTL v2, other Maghreb countries v3)
- Full-text search patient cross-field (tsvector-powered)
- Dashboard: activity KPIs, medical KPIs, financial KPIs, waiting time

## Public landing page — separate deliverable (planned 2026-04-24)

User plans a public marketing landing page (`/` on the apex domain) that introduces careplus to prospective cabinets. Should NOT live inside `frontend/` — different audience, different SEO/perf needs, different deploy cadence.

**Recommended architecture:**
- Separate Vite + React (or Astro, which is better for marketing sites because it ships zero JS by default — worth a 15-min spike when we start).
- Deployed to **Vercel** or **Netlify** free tier — both keep the landing page always-on (no cold starts, critical for first impressions) and are independent from the app's Render deploy.
- DNS split: `careplus.ma` (apex) → landing page, `app.careplus.ma` → the SICM on Render.
- Reuse tokens: copy `frontend/src/styles/tokens.css` verbatim so the landing page visually matches the product (same Clinical Blue, same type scale). Consider extracting tokens to a tiny `@careplus/tokens` npm package if we ever have a third surface.
- Content: Moroccan market positioning, loi 09-08 compliance, cabinet testimonials post-pilot, pricing (eventually), contact/demo request form (wired to a Google Sheet via Formspree free tier, or to a `/api/public/contact` endpoint added then).

**NOT recommended:**
- Stuffing marketing pages into the existing `frontend/` app — unnecessary bundle bloat, mixes audiences, ties SEO to the auth-gated SPA.
- Hosting the landing page on Render free — cold starts would ruin first impressions.

## Frontend — moved into MVP scope 2026-04-24

Was "Angular 17 + PrimeNG after backend MVP". Superseded by the hi-fi React prototype delivered from Claude Design (see `design/prototype/` + `design/HANDOFF.md`). Frontend stack changed to **React 18 + Vite + TypeScript** to port the prototype pixel-perfectly. Scope added to `SPRINT_MVP.md` as J8–J10. Remaining post-MVP FE items:

- Generated TypeScript client from OpenAPI spec (nice-to-have; MVP ports screens against hand-rolled fetch hooks first)
- NgRx Signals / Zustand state management audit (after pilot feedback)
- PWA offline-light mode (read-only historical data if backend unreachable)
- i18n layer (Arabic RTL)
- Storybook + Chromatic visual regression (after primitive library stabilises)

## Packaging & distribution

- jpackage Windows installer (.exe, signed MSI)
- Embedded JRE + embedded Postgres installer
- Windows services auto-start
- Uninstaller
- Docker image for cloud deployment
- Helm chart (if any cabinet chain ever needs k8s)

## Compliance

- CNDP declaration template
- Patient consent capture at creation
- Right-of-access export (ZIP of dossier)
- Right-to-be-forgotten: anonymization job
- 10-year retention policy enforcement

## Not in our plan but worth considering

- Teleconsultation (WebRTC) — only if market demand clear, high maintenance cost
- E-prescription national (does not exist in Morocco 2026 — watch)
- Pharmacovigilance reporting to CAPM (adverse effects declaration)
- Integration with Moroccan health insurance electronic claims (none live in 2026)

## How to add an entry

Append under the right theme. No dates, no owners — this is a holding pen until prioritized. When an item is pulled into a sprint, move it to `SPRINT_<NAME>.md` and delete from this file.
